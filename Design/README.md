# <p align="center">TitlaPong Design Overview</p>

This README is designed to hold information regarding TiltaPong's design. Because the design is image and document heavy, it has been given a separate document to avoid clutter on the main page.

## <a name="DesignDocument"></a>Design Document

All mechanics and important design decisions are documented in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BxIRuREkCNnnhHKFHiHDU0i9Xp5bomv3vNINLLLVrhU/edit?usp=sharing). Anyone is allowed to view and add comments to the document in Google Docs. However, only permitted authors have the security to edit the document. This security helps prevents important documentation from going unnoticed and can help keep the team informed about all important updates. The design document is updated dynamically when important decisions are made during development. As such, it is not a complete document until the game's development is finished.

## <a name="UIAndBehaviour"></a>UI and Behaviour Prototypes

Below, wireframes for prototype UI are provided for various screens and menus located within the game. Due to the nature of a wireframe, these do not contain any game art. They are simply used to indicate the placement of different elements visible to the player.

In addition to wireframes, the intended player behaviour is documented using user flow diagrams. The following key can be used to discern the meanings of their shapes and colours.
- Green circle - Action that initiates the UI
- Blue rectangle - Actions that are descriptive and/or happen automatically
- Yellow diamond - A decision point in the behaviour made by the player or program
- Red circle - Action that ends the behaviour for a given UI and either leads to another UI or closes the game

In the following sections a 'scene' refers to a Unity Scene.

Note: throughout the UI, players are always given a route through which they may quit their current match or the game itself.

## <a name="HomeScene"></a> Home Scene

The Home Scene is the scene the player encounters when launching the game application. The Home Scene is synonymous with 'start screen'.

## <a name="SettingsScene"></a> Settings Scene

The Settings Scene is where players will be able to modify settings outside of gameplay. Here they can change settings involving game behaviour, sounds, and visuals. Game behaviour settings can only be changed within this scene; they cannot be adjusted mid-game.

## <a name="FindPlayerScene"></a> Find Player Scene

The Find Player Scene is used as an intermediate scene when players are playing against an online opponent. Here, the game will search for an available player until one is found. The player is able to cancel and return to the previous scene at any time during this process.

## <a name="GameplayScene"></a> Gameplay Scene

The Gameplay Scene is where the actual game takes place. Here players will play TiltaPong against either a computer or online opponent until the win condition is met. The full core gameplay loop is visualised through the corresponding user flow diagram.

## <a name="GameplayPauseMenu"></a>Gameplay Pause Menu

Pausing the game during gameplay produces a menu that players must interact with. They can close the menu and continue the game, change some aesthetic settings, or quit the current game. The behaviour for pausing a game while playing an online opponent has not yet been defined.

## <a name="GameEndScene"></a> Game End Scene

The Game End Scene is entered after a player wins or loses a game of TiltaPong. The text on the screen varies depending on whether the player won or lost their game. From here, users can quit the game, or return to the Home Scene.

## <a name="UnderConstructionScene"></a> Under Construction Scene

The Under Construction Scene is meant to act as a placeholder for scenes that have not been developed. The scene's primary purpose is to alert players that a feature is coming, but also give them a way to return to the Home Scene.
