## <a name="ProjectOverview"></a> Project Overview

This is a demo project for Popped Corn, a collaborative game development project for the Bristol Game Creators' Club. Through this recreation of Pong, I hope to provide a tangible (well, as tangible as software can actually be) of a working project. Below, I will post images and briefly describe different processes of the project.

## <a name="ProjectManagementOverview"></a> Project Management Overview

TiltaPong has been managed using Agile methodology. For its development, I have created a roadmap.

This Roadmap covers the major milestones for the project's development, called epics. The epics are each broken into tasks that are managed on a weekly basis, called sprints. Each epic has been colour-coordinated on this roadmap to match the corresponding colours of tasks, which are recorded using [Trello](https://trello.com), a free project-management software tool.
